# COMP307_Assign1-3
Part 3: Perceptron
For part 3, I had a lot of trouble making it work. It's the hardest part of the assignment as I somehow 
managed to introduce a bug that I couldnâ€™t fix. I did understand the theory behind what's happening but I just 
had an issue with the actual implementation of the assignment.


Technology Used: Mainly Eclipse
